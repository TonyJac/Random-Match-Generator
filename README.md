# Random-Match-Generator
Just a python script that allows you to make a bracket for tournaments, given the list of players

This came to fruition when my friends and I decided to have a bracket match tournament for Call of Duty but fixing the matches were a waste of time and not to mention, difficult. To overcome that, I made a script to randomize the fixtures and decide who plays against whom.

### Adding a GUI
To make it more user friendly, the script was given a very basic GUI using PySimpleGUI python package.

### Running on CLI
Open the folder in terminal
'''

python3 gui.py
